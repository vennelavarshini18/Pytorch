# Pytorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is widely used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. PyTorch provides two high-level features: tensor computation (similar to NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. It is known for its flexibility and ease of use, making it popular among researchers and practitioners for developing and training deep learning models.
It is based on Torch Library, alothough python interface is more polished it also has c++ interface.

CUDA: CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model created by NVIDIA. It allows developers to use NVIDIA GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for general-purpose processing.
CUDA enables the execution of compute-intensive tasks much faster than traditional CPUs by leveraging the massively parallel architecture of GPUs.

COMMAND TO CHECK PYTORCH INSTALLATION: python -c  "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"

## Tensors

Used as a replacement of numpy to use the power of GPUs.
The basic unit which enables us to utilise the maximum power of the GPU (parallel processing).

A tensor is a generalisation of vectors and matrices and can be easily understandable as a mathematical array.It is a term and set of techniques known in machine learning and deep learning training and operational models.
